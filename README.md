This is a to-do list project done to understand SOLID design principles and clean code in OOP!

Had to take an 8 day break from this project, during which I read "Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby" by Sandi Metz.

Even though I use JS and not Ruby, I felt the book was super informational and I tried to refactor some of my code according to its principles.

I still broke some things and got messy but overall I feel I improved for next time. 

PS: I'll still need to come back and design the CSS for this one, but the 8 day break coupled with the refactoring made me take too long on this project
